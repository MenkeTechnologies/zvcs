### `[GIT, SHADOWED AND SUPERSET — ONE RUST BINARY NAMED git]`

> *"gitoxide already ported git to Rust. zvcs does the thing git structurally
> cannot: fair mutual exclusion, self-attaching submodules, forward-only
> pointer bumps — a VCS built for a meta-repo under many concurrent agents."*

**zvcs** is a git-shadowing superset VCS. It ships a single Rust binary named
`git` that shadows stock git on `PATH` and serves subcommands natively via
vendored [gitoxide](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide) crates — there is
**no fork/exec of stock git**. On top of git compatibility it adds the zvcs
**superset**: coordination verbs stock git cannot have, aimed at the exact
failure modes of driving a large meta-repo of submodules under many concurrent
automated agents.

The world's-first leg is not "git in Rust" — gitoxide is already that. It is the
superset coordination layer: a fair FIFO index-lock daemon, a
reconcile-to-mainline attacher, and forward-only gitlink bumps, served from the
same binary that answers `rev-parse`.

## [0x00] OVERVIEW

zvcs is a from-source VCS, not a wrapper. The `git` binary discovers and reads
the same on-disk `.git` directory stock git does, so tools already on `PATH`
(RustRover, `gh`, `cargo`) see identical behavior. Git-compat porcelain is
ported incrementally on top of the vendored gitoxide (`gix`) library; when a
subcommand is not yet ported the binary errors terse rather than falling through
to stock git — this is a from-scratch engine, not a shim.

The reason zvcs exists is the superset. The meta-repo it targets is a shell of
git submodules driven by up to 16 concurrent automated agents. Stock git handles
that topology poorly in three specific, reproducible ways, and each superset verb
closes one of them.

## [0x01] THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

| Stock-git failure mode | zvcs answer |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **`index.lock` contention.** Git guards index writes with an `O_EXCL` lockfile; a contended writer does not wait, it *fails* (`Unable to create '.git/index.lock'`). Under N agents that is a thundering herd of retries with no fairness. | **`zdaemon`** — one machine-wide daemon with a **per-repo FIFO lane** replaces the flock. A contended writer blocks in arrival order and is answered `GRANTED` only at the head of its repo's lane; first-come-first-served, no starvation, unrelated repos fully parallel. |
| **Detached HEAD by default.** `git submodule update` leaves every submodule on a detached HEAD, so committed work is orphaned unless the caller re-attaches by hand. | **`zsync`** + the daemon's **attach-scan** reconcile each submodule to its tracked mainline (`origin/main`, else `origin/master`) and keep `HEAD` *attached* — even a dirty detached HEAD is rescued in place (no-clobber ref op). Fast-forward only. |
| **Constant `modified: <sub> (new commits)` markers + stale pointers.** Every submodule commit dirties the parent's gitlink; a blanket `git add` can also move it *backwards*. | **`zbump`** + **autobump** — forward-only gitlink bumps, **committed** (clears the marker), coalesced, done by the daemon on a file-watch so agents never touch the root. Never regresses a pointer. |
| **Agents colliding on one shared tree.** N agents editing one meta tree collide on files, index, and HEAD. | **`zworktree`** — one command gives each agent a private, object-sharing worktree of the whole submodule tree; complete isolation, no re-clone. |

## [0x02] BUILD

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zvcs
cd zvcs
cargo build
./target/debug/git rev-parse HEAD
```

The workspace has two members-by-convention: `src/ported` (the vendored gitoxide
crates, a self-contained workspace excluded from the root) is consumed by
`src/extensions` (the zvcs crate) as a path dependency. `gix` is built with the
`blocking-http-transport-reqwest-rust-tls` feature so `zsync`'s reconcile fetch
runs over HTTPS on a pure-Rust TLS stack — no curl/openssl C toolchain.

## [0x03] SUBCOMMANDS

Two namespaces share one dispatch table (`src/extensions/src/dispatch.rs`):

- **superset** verbs (`z*`) — the novel coordination layer.
- **git-compat** porcelain — stock git subcommands served via gitoxide, ported
  incrementally.

| Verb group | Verbs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Coordination | `zdaemon` `zsync` `zbump` `zup` | singleton daemon; reconcile submodules; forward-only bumps; `zup` brings the whole tree (parent + nested submodules) to latest `origin/main` |
| Stash | `zstash` `zunstash` `zstashes` | park/restore uncommitted work across the whole submodule tree as one unit |
| Repo index | `zrepos` `zreindex` | machine-wide index of every git repo (retires a shell repo-list) |
| Async queue | `zcommit` `zpush` `zjobs` `zjob` | fire-and-forget commit/push jobs + ledger (`zjob stop`/`restart`) |
| Multi-agent | `zclaim` `zunclaim` `zwho` | advisory per-repo leases so agents don't collide |
| Observability | `zstatus [--all]` `zlog` `zundo` | instant machine-wide status; cross-repo timeline; one-step rewind |
| Snapshots | `zsnapshot` `zrestore` `zsnapshots` | tree-wide restore points across all submodules |
| Worktrees | `zworktree add/list/remove` | per-agent isolated, object-sharing worktree of the whole tree |
| Fan-out | `zforeach [selectors] -- <cmd>` | run a command across all/subset of indexed repos, in parallel (selectors: `--repo`/`--dirty`/`--ahead`/`--behind`/`--claimed`/`--session`) |
| Parallel query | `zheads` `zdirty` `zbranches` `ztags` `zremotes` `zsize` `zage` | native, fork-free reads fanned across every indexed repo — HEAD/branch, dirty set, branches, tag counts, remotes, `.git` sizes, HEAD age; all honor the `zforeach` selectors |
| Parallel pull | `zpull [selectors]` | fetch + fast-forward every indexed repo in parallel (ff-only, same native reconcile as `zsync`; dirty/diverged skipped) |
| Hooks | `zhook set/unset/show/list/test` | manage & test the current repo's ref-change hook (`zvcs.hook`); `zvcs.autohook` fires each repo's own local hook |
| Triggers | `ztrigger DIR <cmd>` `ztrigger list/rm/test` | arm any repo BY PATH to run a command on **any file change** in the directory (worktree + `.git`) — writes DIR's local hook, indexes it, watches the whole dir, auto-flips `zvcs.autohook`, reloads the daemon (no `git config` needed) |
| Watch | `zwatch DIR` `zwatch list/rm` | watch a repo by path (index + cached status via `zvcs.autostatus`) without attaching a command |
| Console | `zrepl` | interactive line console over **every** command — each line runs as `git <line>`, so the `z*` verbs and all git porcelain work alike (startup stats banner + Tab completion of every verb) |
| Shell | `zcd` `zpwd` `zls` `zenv` `zunset` `zecho` `zmkdir` `ztouch` `zrm` `zcp` `zmv` `zcat` `zln` | shell builtins so `zrepl` drives like a shell — `zcd`/`zenv`/`zunset` mutate the console's cwd/environment and persist across lines; `zls` is a git-aware listing (per-file status like `eza --git`); `zmkdir`/`ztouch`/`zrm`/`zcp`/`zmv`/`zcat`/`zln` are native filesystem commands (`zrm`/`zmv` are on-disk, distinct from `git rm`/`git mv`) |
| Discovery | `zverbs` | list every extension verb and its one-line usage (sourced from each verb's own `-h`) |
| Health | `zdoctor` | environment health check — git shadow on PATH, daemon, ledger, man pages, MANPATH, dashed forms (OK/WARN/FAIL, exits non-zero on FAIL) |
| git-compat | every stock subcommand | dispatched natively; depth varies — see the parity report |

Every subcommand stock git ships has a dispatch arm, so nothing reaches the
`not yet ported` path; there is no fallthrough to stock git. Dispatching is not
the same as agreeing with git, and the two are measured separately — an
unimplemented flag errors terse rather than guessing, and the parity harness
scores that as a failure.

**External and dashed forms (full shadow).** An unknown verb follows git's exact
precedence — builtin → `git-<verb>` on `PATH` (git.c's `execv_dashed_external`) →
`help_unknown_cmd` — so third-party subcommands (`git fuzzy`, `git lfs`,
`git flow`, …) work under the shim; without this, git-fuzzy breaks (it recurses
through `git fuzzy helper` on every keystroke). The binary also honors dashed
invocation: run as `git-<verb>` it strips the prefix from argv[0] and dispatches
`<verb>`. `git zdashed [<dir>]` installs a `git-<verb>` symlink for every verb
into `<dir>` (default `~/.zvcs/bin`), so the dashed forms exist once stock git is
removed. Verbs come from the dispatch tables, so the set never drifts.

Run the harness to see current depth per subcommand:

```sh
cargo run -p zvcs-parity                 # curated corpus
cargo run -p zvcs-parity -- --fuzz 12    # plus generated flag combinations
```

It builds fixture repositories with stock git, runs each invocation against both
binaries, and compares stdout, exit code, and the resulting repository state.

## [0x04] THE SUPERSET VERBS

**Coordination.** `git zsync [<path>...]` reconciles submodules to their tracked
mainline (`origin/main`, else `origin/master`), fast-forward only, leaving `HEAD`
attached; a dirty worktree is skipped. `git zbump [<path>...]` advances the
parent's gitlink to each submodule's HEAD **only** on a fast-forward, then
**commits** the coalesced bumps (clearing the `(new commits)` marker). `git
zdaemon <start|stop|status>` controls the singleton coordinator (below). `git
zdaemon <start|stop|restart|reload|status|info|ping|log>` is the full daemon
control surface — `restart`/`reload` respawn it (re-reading config), `ping` is a
scriptable liveness check, `info` prints pid/socket/paths/config, and `log [-n
N] [-f]` shows/tails `~/.zvcs/zvcs.log`. `git
zup` brings the whole tree — the top-level repo **and** every nested submodule —
to latest `origin/main` (fetch + fast-forward, attached; dirty/diverged skipped).

**Stash.** `git zstash [<name>]` parks uncommitted work across every dirty repo
in the tree as one named unit, `git zunstash [<name>]` restores it (LIFO), and
`git zstashes` lists them. Restore applies onto the same commits it was stashed
on (3-way apply onto a moved HEAD is the not-yet-ported porcelain territory; a
repo whose HEAD moved is reported and its stash kept intact).

**Repo index.** `git zreindex [--sync|--async] [<path>...]` crawls for git
repositories and records them in the ledger, pruning ones deleted from disk;
`git zrepos` lists them (pipe-clean, one path per line) — a drop-in for a shell
git-repo index. The walk is parallel and skips the mounts that would hang or loop
a whole-device scan (`zreindex /`): kernel pseudo-filesystems, automounted/network
volumes, and the macOS data-volume firmlink reflection. At a terminal it runs
**async** by default — the crawl detaches to the background (results → `zvcs.log`,
follow with `git zdaemon log -f`) and the prompt returns immediately; piped or
scripted it runs **inline** so `indexed N, pruned M` stays on stdout. `--sync`
and `--async` override the default.

**Async queue.** `git zcommit <paths> -m <msg> [--push]` and `git zpush` submit
fire-and-forget jobs to the daemon (with a network-free / live `ls-refs` push
pre-flight that refuses a non-fast-forward before enqueue) and return a job
number; `git zjobs` / `git zjob <id>` show the ledger, and `git zjob stop|restart
<id>` control a running/queued job. Falls back to synchronous execution when no
daemon is running.

**Multi-agent.** `git zclaim [<path>]` takes an advisory per-repo lease for the
session (`ZVCS_SESSION`), refusing if another agent holds it; `git zunclaim`
releases and `git zwho` lists who holds what.

**Observability.** `git zstatus` reports the current repo's status live; `git
zstatus --all` reads every indexed repo's status from the daemon-maintained
cache (zero-walk). `git zlog` merges every repo's reflog into one machine-wide
timeline; `git zundo [<path>]` rewinds a repo one step (`reset --hard` to the
previous HEAD, refuses on dirty).

**Snapshots.** `git zsnapshot <name>` records the HEAD of the repo + every nested
submodule as one restore point; `git zrestore <name>` resets the whole tree back
to it; `git zsnapshots` lists them.

**Worktrees.** `git zworktree add <name>` provisions a complete, object-sharing,
isolated worktree of the repo + all nested submodules (each on a `zwt/<name>`
branch) at `~/.zvcs/worktrees/<name>/`, so each agent gets a private tree that
can't collide with any other — no re-clone. `list` / `remove <name>` manage them.

**Console.** `git zrepl` opens an interactive line console. Each line is run
exactly as `git <line>` would be, so it drives **every** dispatchable command —
the `z*` superset verbs and every git-compat porcelain command alike (the latter
operating on the current repo) — doubling as a live daemon/ledger console. On a
tty it opens with a stats banner and edits with Tab-completion of every verb plus
persistent history; piped stdin falls back to a raw reader so scripts stay
usable.

**Shell builtins.** Because the console is one long-lived process, a handful of
shell verbs make it navigable like a shell: `git zcd [<dir>|-]` changes the
working directory (persisting across lines, `~`/`-` supported), `git zpwd` prints
it, and `git zls [-alrt] [<path>]` is a git-aware listing — each entry carries a
two-column git status field (staged, then unstaged) like `eza --git`, a directory
folding the status of the paths under it, colored from the same palette eza reads
(`LS_COLORS` for file kinds/extensions, `EXA_COLORS`/`EZA_COLORS` for permissions,
size, date, and git columns). `git zenv [<NAME=VALUE>...]` prints,
sets, or queries environment variables —
anything set persists so every later `git` line sees it — `git zunset <NAME>...`
clears them, and `git zecho [-n] <arg>...` prints its arguments. The mutating
verbs (`zcd`/`zenv`/`zunset`) only affect this process, so they are aimed at the
console. Rounding out the set are native filesystem commands — `git zmkdir [-p]`,
`git ztouch`, `git zrm [-r] [-f]`, `git zcp [-r]`, `git zmv`, `git zcat`, and
`git zln [-s]` — so files can be created, copied, moved, and removed without
leaving the console. These act on disk (no fork); `zrm`/`zmv` are distinct from
`git rm`/`git mv`, which stage changes in the index.

**Discovery & help.** `git zverbs` lists every extension verb with its one-line
usage (each verb also answers `-h` with the same line). `git help <zverb>` opens
a full man page — the pages are generated from a table in
`src/extensions/src/superset/manpage.rs` (one source of truth, covering every
verb in `SUPERSET_VERBS`), written on demand under `~/.zvcs/man` and opened with
`man -M`, so it works with no setup. `git zdashed` writes them all up front, so
`man git-<verb>` resolves once `~/.zvcs/man` is on `MANPATH`:

```sh
export MANPATH="$HOME/.zvcs/man:$MANPATH"
man git-zsync
```

## [0x05] THE zdaemon COORDINATOR

`zdaemon` is one machine-wide daemon (state under `~/.zvcs/`, socket
`~/.zvcs/zvcs.sock`) — the fair replacement for `index.lock` plus the host for
autonomy, the SQLite ledger, and the async job queue. It is reactive: **no
timers, no polling**; a `git pull`/commit updates local refs, a `notify`
file-watch fires, and the daemon reacts. It never contacts a remote itself.

The lock is **per-repo**: unrelated repos run fully in parallel; only writers to
the same repo serialize, first-come-first-served. Clients reach it through
`RepoLock::acquire` (`src/extensions/src/lock.rs`), an RAII guard; release is
automatic on drop and on socket EOF, so a crashed holder can't wedge a repo. With
no daemon the lock degrades to a no-op guard (the op still runs). Index writes
also go through `index.lock` via `gix-lock` for interop with stock git.

Wire protocol — line-based over the unix socket:

| Line | Direction | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `ACQUIRE <id> <git-dir>` | client → daemon | Enqueue on that repo's lane; answered `GRANTED` at its head. |
| `RELEASE <id>` | client → daemon | Current holder releases; next waiter granted. |
| `SUBMIT <json>` | client → daemon | Queue an async job; answered `JOB <id>`. |
| `JOBSTOP <id>` / `JOBRESTART <id>` | client → daemon | Cancel / re-enqueue a job. |
| `STATUS` / `STOP` | client → daemon | Snapshot / shut down. |

### Autonomous mode + configuration

All autonomy is gated by `[zvcs]` gitconfig and **defaults off**, so it runs in
the dev environment and nowhere else. Enable it in `~/.gitconfig` or a repo's
`.git/config`; stock git ignores the keys:

```gitconfig
[zvcs]
    autoreconcile = true            ; reconcile clean submodules to origin/main (reactive)
    autobump      = true            ; forward-only local pointer bumps + commit (kills the marker)
    interval      = 2               ; debounce window (seconds) for coalescing bursts
    autocrawl     = true            ; background repo-index crawl on daemon start
    crawlroots    = /abs/src /abs/wk ; crawler roots (absolute; default $HOME)
    autostatus    = true            ; maintain zstatus --all
    hook          = /abs/on-change  ; run on ref-change in any indexed repo (typed event env)
    autohook      = true            ; fire each repo's own local zvcs.hook (no global hook needed)
    worktreebase  = /abs/worktrees  ; base for zworktree (default ~/.zvcs/worktrees)
```

When anything is enabled, a `git` invocation auto-spawns the daemon (detached,
output to `~/.zvcs/zvcs.log`); it watches indexed repos and reacts by attaching
detached HEADs, fetch-free reconciling, forward-only autobumping, maintaining
status, and firing hooks. A dirty worktree or a diverged/ahead branch is always
skipped — autonomy never regresses or clobbers in-flight work. Headless failures
are recorded in the ledger and surfaced on your **next `git` command** (stderr).

Hooks get a typed environment: `ZVCS_EVENT` (commit/checkout/merge/pull/rebase/
reset), `ZVCS_REPO`, `ZVCS_GIT_DIR`, `ZVCS_OLD_SHA`, `ZVCS_NEW_SHA`, `ZVCS_REF` —
enough for "on commit in X, do Y in repo Z" cross-repo rules.

You never have to touch `[zvcs]` config by hand to wire a trigger — `ztrigger`
does it all. Arm any repo by path and the command runs on **any file change** in
that directory (worktree *and* `.git`) — creating a file, editing, committing:

```console
$ git ztrigger ~/src/api 'make test'   # writes ~/src/api local hook, indexes it,
                                        # watches the WHOLE dir, flips autohook,
                                        # reloads the daemon
$ git ztrigger .        'echo "$ZVCS_EVENT" | notify'   # arm the current repo
$ git ztrigger list                    # every armed repo (path <tab> command)
$ git ztrigger test ~/src/api          # fire it once now, without waiting
$ git ztrigger rm   ~/src/api          # disarm

$ git zwatch ~/src/api                 # watch (index + cached status), no command
$ git zwatch list                      # indexed repos, flagged watch|trigger
```

An armed repo watches its entire directory, so file changes fire — not only ref
moves — and there is **no debounce**: the hook runs the instant an event arrives.
One filesystem event may carry several paths, but a repo fires once per event.
A hook that writes back into the watched directory will re-fire on its own writes
— keep trigger commands side-effect-free or point them at another repo.

Only repos you `ztrigger` carry a hook, and the daemon is a no-op for the rest —
so the set of firing repos is exactly the ones you armed, with no extra list to
maintain. `zhook` is the same operation scoped to the current repo.

## [0x06] LAYOUT

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `src/ported` | Vendored gitoxide crates (`gix` + the `gix-*` library crates), in-tree. A self-contained workspace, excluded from the root and consumed as a path dependency. The `gix`/`ein` CLI binaries and their `gitoxide-core` backend are removed; `git` is the only binary. |
| `src/extensions` | The zvcs crate (library + the `git` binary): `main.rs`/`lib.rs` (entry, `session_key`, notify-on-next-command), `dispatch.rs` (routing), `porcelain/` (git-compat), `lock.rs` (daemon client), `config.rs` (`[zvcs]` settings), `autostart.rs` (daemon auto-spawn), `db.rs` (SQLite ledger/index), `crawler.rs` (repo crawl), `jobpool.rs`/`jobrun.rs`/`index_commit.rs` (async jobs), `worktree.rs` (checkout helper), and `superset/` (`zdaemon`, `zsync`, `zbump`, `reconcile`, `attach`, `watch`, `hooks`, `trigger`, `ledger`, `status`, `oplog`, `snapshot`, `claim`, `queue`, `repl`, `zworktree`). |

## [0x07] STATUS & ROADMAP

Early and in active development.

The coordination and superset layers are implemented and tested: the singleton
daemon with per-repo FIFO lanes; reactive file-watcher autonomy (attach,
autobump-with-commit, fetch-free reconcile); the SQLite ledger + repo index;
async `zcommit`/`zpush` with job control; multi-agent claims; machine-wide
`zstatus`; the cross-repo op ledger (`zlog`/`zundo`); tree-wide snapshots; typed
cross-repo hooks; and per-agent isolated worktrees (`zworktree`). Each is covered
by an integration test, and zvcs↔stock-git interoperability (round-trip read,
`git fsck`, submodule pointer bumps, worktrees) is verified by a regression
suite. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and the honest list of
partials.

Git compatibility is tracked as two independent numbers, because a subcommand
that dispatches is not thereby correct:

- **Coverage** — every subcommand stock git ships is dispatched natively.
- **Parity** — the share of harness cases whose stdout, exit code, and resulting
  repository state match stock git exactly.

Parity is the number that matters and it is the work that remains. Depth varies
widely per subcommand; some are byte-faithful across their documented flag set,
others implement the common flags and bail terse on the rest. A few subcommands
are honest skeletons that name the missing substrate instead of pretending:
the foreign-SCM bridges (`p4`, `cvsimport`, `cvsserver`, `cvsexportcommit`,
`archimport`) and the shell/Perl tools (`imap-send`, `instaweb`, `subtree`,
`filter-branch`) have no gitoxide backing to port onto.

Mutating subcommands are currently excluded from generated fuzz cases, so their
parity rests on curated cases only. Treat their scores as less well covered than
the read-only ones rather than as evidence of correctness.
