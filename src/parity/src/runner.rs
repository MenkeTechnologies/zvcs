//! The differential runner: one case, run twice, compared four ways.

//! A case is judged on stdout bytes, exit code, and the *resulting repository
//! state* — that last one is what makes this more than an output diff. A
//! command can print the right thing and still corrupt the index; probing the
//! post-state with stock git in both repos catches that.
//!
//! stderr is deliberately not byte-compared. Error prose is not a compatibility
//! surface and zvcs is specified to be terser than git. It is still recorded so
//! a human can read it, and whether the command *errored at all* is compared
//! via the exit code.
